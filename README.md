# Python
Translator.py is a small project developed by using CML(Cloud Machine Learning) in python language.
This project is using speech_reconginition library to recognize the user's speech and gTTS to convert the speech into text and googletrasn library to 
translate that text.
I had used Tkinter in this for making A simple GUI.
If You wanna run this code on your machine then you must have all libraries those are mentioned above.
