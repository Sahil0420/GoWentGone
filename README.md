## Go Learning Roadmap

This repository contains a personal, accelerated learning roadmap for mastering the Go programming language.

## About

The primary goal of this repository is to document a **fast-paced, hands-on journey through Go**. Each subdirectory and file is crafted to capture essential concepts, patterns, and practical exercises, all designed with speed and efficiency in mind.

- **For Learners:** Use this as a guide or inspiration for your own rapid Go studies.
- **For Myself:** Tracks progress, experiments, and lessons learned as new topics are tackled daily and weekly.

## Contents

- Self-contained Go programs on core syntax, standard library usage, and real-world patterns
- Brief guides and code snippets for each topic, designed for direct execution and quick review
- Occasional notes and references for deeper dives

## Structure

The layout generally follows best practices for Go projects and learning repos:
- Individual `.go` files for each concept and exercise
- The `cmd/` or main directory for standalone applications
- Supporting folders as needed for modularity or extended topics
